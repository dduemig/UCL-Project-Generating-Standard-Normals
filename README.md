# dduemig-UCL-Project-Generating-Standard-Normals
In this repo, we examine several methods of pseudo-random number sampling. Specifically, we generate numbers that are distributed with the Gaussian (Normal) distribution, starting from the random number generator of a computer. In order to check whether what we have generated is actually Gaussian or Pareto distributed, we apply various normality tests. Finally, to illustrate the applications of this method, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation in which we calculate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a given portfolio.
